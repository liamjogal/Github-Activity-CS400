Beginning (Liam)
Once upon a time a man came across a pill that had the power to make him great and successful. He thought there was no downsides to this pill, until he discovered that the pill also had devastating consequences. Ultimately, he decided to take this pill even though the future was unclear. 
Middle (Joseph)
At first, the pill had no down sides. The man created one of the most successful companies in the world and becomes a millionare within only a few weeks. However, as the man became more successful, the more people began to dislike who he was. He became too powerful, too successful. He became corrupted, mistreated his workers and abused his power and wealth. Blind in his greed, he never knew what was about to hit him.
